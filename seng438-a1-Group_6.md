# Introduction

This following lab report provides a detailed summary of the exploratory testing, manual scripted testing, and regression testing done on an ATM simulation system. The issue tracking system used to manage the bugs found was Azure DevOps. Prior to this lab, we knew that exploratory testing is a testing approach that focuses on freedom and discovery. As a tester, this is the time for you to explore the system however you like without the guidance of a script or test plan. Moreover, our group had a high level of understanding of manual scripted testing due to prior internship experience in testing. This experience helped our group with designing a test suite/plan, writing test cases, and eventually running them manually through ADO's test editor. Overall, this lab was a great way to further solidify our understanding of software testing and promote collaboration and teamwork within our group.

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

Our exploratory test plan is intended to test the various services that an ATM must provide to a customer. The key functions that our test plan targets include but is not limited to processing multiple transactions, cash withdrawal from different accounts, deposits through cash and/or cheques, transfer money between two accounts, request a balance inquiry, and abort a transaction. The approach that is taken for this test plan is more of a behavioral testing strategy where the main focus will be on how our system acts rather than the mechanism behind its functions. This black-box approach makes our test plan centered more around the end-user's perspective rather than running the entirety of the system. We plan to come up with the test cases by covering multiple user profiles as well as usage scenarios. In summary, our exploratory test plan is designed to test a fully integrated ATM system rather than each of it's individual components.

-   Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.

# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided 

To divide the work for this lab, our group split into two pairs (Mohamed and Nour & Krishna and Zuhaer) to perfrom the initial exploratory, manual scripted and regression testing. To manage the different findings of each pair, we created two test plans in Azure DevOps that had the same manual scripted and regresstion test suites but different exploratory test suites. Each pair was responsible for conducting the testing and analyzing the results. After both pairs were done testing their seperate test plans, we got into a call over discord to discuss each pairs findings. After careful discussion, we reached a consensus on any differences that may have arised from our testing. Lastly, two group members were then responsible for creating the defect report using excel while the other two were responsible for writing the lab report.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

Our group faced many difficulties and challenges throughout the lab that were necessary to go through in order to reach the objectives of the lab. Some of the difficulties we encountered include choosing the right issue tracking system, not being to able to use certain services in Azure DevOps due to licensing requirements, and managing permissions/access levels of all group members. To overcome these challenges, we first experimented with both Jira and Azure DevOps and collectively agreed on ADO as the issue tracking system to use due to its comprehensive agile reporting and advanced traceability. Moreover, our group originally was under the basic plan for ADO which limited the individual services we could access. To upgrade our plan, we started a free basic + test plans trial which granted us access to all the services we needed to complete this assignment. Lastly, each one of our group members was added as a project administrator to ensure that everyone had the same permissions and access level. The most valuable lessons learned from the group include patience is key to testing, proper planning is vital to ensure the efficient workflow of a team, and team work makes the dream work.

# Comments/feedback on the lab and lab document itself

Overall, our group found the lab document easy to follow and work through. In addition, we found it as useful practice of testing a software sytem and helped us better understand the differences between the three different types of testing. However, we think the integration of pair testing in this lab made the testing process a bit repetitive and tedious.
